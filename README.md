# MULTI-OBJECTIVE-OPTIMIZED-DESIGN-OF-GEOSYNTHETIC-REINFORCED-EARTH-RETAINING-WALL-USING-NSGA-II-

This project focuses on the multi-objective optimization of geosynthetic reinforced earth (GRE) retaining wall design using genetic algorithms. The conflicting objectives considered are minimizing the total cost and maximizing the wall height. The optimization problem is formulated by considering various design constraints related to external and internal stability, as well as seismic stability. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is employed to obtain a set of non-dominated solutions, representing the trade-off between cost and height. The report discusses the problem formulation, single-objective optimization results, multi-objective optimization results with Pareto fronts, and conclusions. The project demonstrates the application of advanced optimization techniques for cost-effective and height-optimized design of GRE walls in civil engineering.
